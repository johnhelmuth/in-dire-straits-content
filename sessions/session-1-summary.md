The Dire Straits shoots the strait from Ceti Daenia to Zerzi, has a failure in the in-system drive’s power coil regulator. It takes a week to limp to Zerzi Station with Jithal manually regulating the in-system drive’s power to avoid a runaway power cycle causing the ship to explode.

Docked at Zerzi Station, the crew picks up a working power coil regulator for their T73 Dynaflux in-system drive from Crusty’s salvage yard near Zerzi Station, while Jithal caught up on sleep. They returned to the ship and everyone caught up on much-needed sleep.

Chris is awakened by a coded message from a Syndicate contact about a job that paid well, that they really should take. He awakens the rest of the crew and explains that he really needs to meet this guy on the station.  The crew locked the ship up and went to meet Saisar Thoth and find out what the job might be.

The job entailed ferrying a businessman, Dohpaz Vito, to Cuthbert Station and back, no questions asked. They returned to the Dire Straits with Dohpaz Vito. Jithal starts installing the power coil regulator for the in-system drive.
