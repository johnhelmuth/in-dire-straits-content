The strange aliens’ surviving ship, the star-fighter and a shuttle met up and were lost to sensors when they turned on
their stealth systems. Jithal
managed to track them with Grulvax sensors he had installed on the Dire Straits, and the crew noted they were heading
into an empty part of space.

The wreckage of the strange ship was in a decaying orbit and would soon fall into Cuthbert and be crushed by the gas
giant’s atmosphere.

Dohpaz Vito was complaining about heading back to Zerzi. Jithal could sense that the case Dohpaz Vito held contained
some sort of electronic device, that he could not identify.

Deciding that they had time to save the wreckage, but not chase after the alien survivors, the crew would use the Dire
Straits and the Chrysalis to tow the wreckage to a moon of Cuthbert and hide it in a crevasse. Jim would then pilot the
Dire Straits with Dohpaz Vito towards Zerzi, taking it easy so that Jithal, Chris, and Steve could shut down the power
reactor on the alien wreck. (This was so that it would have a better chance to remain hidden.)  They would use the
Chrysalis and the shuttle to catch up to the Dire Straits before it arrived at Zerzi.

Jim Dade and Dohpaz Vito leave Cuthbert orbit on a slow trip towards Zerzi.

Steve, Chris, and Jithal explored the wreckage of the ship after breaking into the intact portion of the ship and
turning off the booby-trapped reactor before it could blow them all up. They discovered the remaining crew had
apparently all committed suicide of one type or another. They gathered biocorder scans of the remains of 3 species (
corpses of frog-like and cat-like aliens and several sets of dust/ashes of a third type,) specimens of same, and several
examples of personal weaponry of the crew (rifles, pistols, knives.)

Steve, Jithal, and Chris then leave the moon of Cuthbert on the shuttle and the Chrysalis to rendezvous with the Dire Straits.
