Steve Irwin, Delano Mack, and Chris visited the Scouts Guild at Alreekt Station to talk about the media event the Scouts Guild wanted to do with the team that discovered the new strait point in Zerzi. Delano Mack did most of the talking. It would take most of a day before the event. Steve Irwin separately took a tour of the offices as part of deciding to join the Guild. 

On their way back to the *Dire Straits* to work on setting up the capability to hide their message for the lost Invicta princess in the event feed, they were intercepted by Craln and a couple of his crew. Carlin was operating as Captain Nelarik of the courier/merchant ship *Lurbon’s Grackle*. Craln/Nelarik was suspicious that the *Dire Straits* crew knew more about the newly discovered hostile aliens, and he wanted to find out that out, and for the *Dire Straits* to travel with him back in Zerzi to help with the hostile aliens.

Steve, Chris, and Delano Mack agreed to sit down for a drink at a local pub to discuss it, and worked out a deal:

The *Dire Straits* crew would give Craln their highly detailed scans of the ships of an unknown alien ship they encountered in exchange for Craln and his crew staying in Bane’s Eye for three days and giving the *Dire Straits* crew operational support in case things get hot. That ship’s scans matched the scans they got from the ships that attacked the *Dire Straits* on the other side of the new strait point.

Steve also told Craln that the specimens and objects they pulled from the alien ship before it sank into a gas giant were given to Dr. Attenborough, who has been working with Dr. Barick to reverse engineer what they found.
