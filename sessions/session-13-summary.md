The crew of the Dire Straits dumped velocity after shooting the strait from Dragongull’s Cry to Bane’s Eye and scanned the system, and pondered their next moves.<!--more --> Chris parked the Dire Straits in a spot between the orbits of Alreeckt and Carkargar that did not have regular traffic, and they started the first parts of their plans.

They decided on three main goals they wanted to reach.

1. Get a lead on where the Princess currently is.  
   1. Chris suggested that they broadcast a message only the princess or someone who knew the princess would recognise, with a meeting place and time.  
   2. They decided the best way to do that was to participate in the Scouts Guild’s media event where they announced the strait point discovery payout to the crew of the Dire Straits, which would be widely broadcast. Delano Mack would be the face of the crew, as showing the Invicta Chris in Bane’s Eye, the place where the virus was created, would be counterproductive.  
   3. Chris would produce a message in the (almost completely unknown) Invicta language, and Jithal would help hack the signal of the media event to include the message as background noise.  
   4. Steve Irwin thought he might be able to use his contacts in the populist ecological support community to make contact with the Banesian Underground.  
2. Find out the extent of Dr. Crimini’s research into the virus that ended the Invicta war.  
   1. **Delano Mack would contact the Bane’s Eye Space Navy and offer up the very detailed scans of the new inimical race’s ship from the other side of the new strait point, in exchange for setting up a meeting with Dr. Crimini.**  
      1. Steve Irwin knew that Dr. Crimini would not meet with him, so Delano is going to be the face.  
   2. Steve Irwin would meet with Dr. Crimini and use Zynara Flonk’s diary to blackmail him into giving up the details of the research.  
3. Get the Syndicate to drop the bounty on Chris and Delano.  
   1. Ask for help from the Scouts Guild… like the Syndicate, they are an inter-cluster organization. They have clashed with the Syndicate in the past.

Delano Mack sent a query to the Scouts Guild about what protection or solution they could offer to help with the Syndicate putting a bounty on Chris and himself. 

Steve Irwin reaches out to people in the extreme ecological support community to find out if anyone knows how to contact the Banesian Underground; he gets a message back after a day… one of the execosupp members is a Steve Irwin fan, and will meet with Steve Irwin and their B.U. contact, includes date and time.

Chris spends a day searching for a good discreet rendezvous point in the Bane’s Eye system to include in the message to meet with the Princess.
