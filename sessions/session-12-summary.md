During the transit across Gold Seed system to the Dragongull’s Cry strait point, several tatternet messages are received on the *Dire Straits*.

Delano Mack gets an [anonymous tatternet message](/sessions/session-12-addenda/anonymous-tatternet-message-for-delano-mack-7922-009-16-45).

Jithal gets a [tatternet message from Dohpaz Vito](/sessions/session-12-addenda/dohpaz-vitos-tatternet-message-for-jithal-7922-009-18-57).

Steve Irwin gets a [tatternet message from Taedala Suda](/sessions/session-12-addenda/taedala-sudas-tatternet-message-for-dr-irwin-7922-009-21-35).

Steve Irwin gets a [tatternet message from Dr. Attenborough](/sessions/session-12-addenda/dr-attenboroughs-tatternet-message-for-dr-irwin-7922-009-22-05).

Steve Irwin replies to Dr. Attenborough’s message (TODO: get the reply from Jon T.)

The *Jitterbug* rendezvous with the *Dire Straits and* docks. The *Dire Straits* shoots the strait from Golden Seed to Dragongull’s Cry at 7922-010 06:00.  In Dragongull’s Cry they dump velocity, and burn onto a course skirting the H’arkot belt on the way to the strait point to Bane’s Eye.

About 2/3s of the way across the system, the *Dire Straits* detects a medium sized merchant, the *Mass Simulator*, moving on a course from the Bane’s Eye strait point to the fuel refinery orbiting the gas giant Cryonulla.  About 5 minutes after the Dire Straits enters the *Mass Simulator*’s sensor envelope, their drive signature stutters and powers down. The merchant ship’s captain, Chendi Jalenduran, broadcasts a distress signal. Their in-system drive almost melted and they were forced to shut it down. In the accident, most of their life support resources were lost to the vacuum of space; they had about an hour left of life support.

When the *Dire Straits* crew shuttles over to the *Mass Simulator* to deliver life support resources, they discover that the distress call was a ruse and Captain Jalenduran and his crew ambush Steve Irwin, Delano Mack, and Jithal as they help to move the containers of life support resources from the shuttle’s airlock into the *Mass Simulator*’s life support chamber. When guns were pulled on them, Jithal managed to slither into a vent to avoid two of the crew members, Delano Mack managed to get the drop on the one who pulled on him, and Steve Irwin and Captain Jalenduran drew as close to simultaneously as didn’t matter. Jithal ripped out and dropped a live high power line down onto the deck in the passageway, shocking insensate the 2 crew members there. Delano Mack struggled to get control of his opponent’s gun. Steve Irwin convinced Captain Jalenduran that he wouldn’t like what Jithal was liable to do when loose on his ship, and they should just go their separate ways. The *Dire Straits’* crew returned to the shuttle and the *Dire Straits*.

The *Dire Straits* continued on their way to the Bane’s Eye strait point and jumped into Bane’s Eye.
