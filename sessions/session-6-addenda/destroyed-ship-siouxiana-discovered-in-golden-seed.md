The wreckage of Slipstream passenger ship the *Siouxiana* was discovered by asteroid miners in the outer reaches of
Golden Seed 10 hours ago. The remains of 10 crew members and 40 passengers were recovered from wreck. 8 crew and 15
passengers have, as yet, not been found.

The *Siouxiana* was en route from the planet Golden Seed to the Zerzi Strait point when its reactor appears to have been
attacked with pinpoint plasma laser fire, causing the explosion.

The *Siouxiana* was owned and operated by the Bane’s Eye corporation Majestic Services, whose representative has not
replied to requests for comments at this time. Stocks of MJSBE are down 3% so far today.
