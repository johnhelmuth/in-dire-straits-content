After the *Jitterbug* and the *Dire Straits* rendezvoused outside the sensor range of Zerzi planet’s defence network, Captain Delano Mack left in the *Jitterbug* on his way to Cuthbert Station as he agreed to during the rendezvous.

Jithal had scanned the ship for tracking devices or signals. He discovered one in the common room, where the rest of the crew and Dohpaz Vito were waiting for the results. He tracked it down: inside the case that Dohpaz Vito had been holding close since Cuthbert Station. The crew convinced Dohpaz to reluctantly let Jithal check it out and see if he could disable it. 

Jithal managed to disable the tracker and also learned a bit more about the device in the case. Unfortunately not enough to understand how it worked or exactly what it did but he could tell it had something to do with interfering with electromagnetic fields passing near the device.

With the tracker disabled, the *Dire Straits* continued the approach to the far side of Zerzi planet so they could drop Dohpaz Vito off at Vito Industries Research Complex \#9. As they approached the geostationary orbit above the complex’s island on the equator, they detected another ship, in an equivalent orbit some miles ahead. 

It was a deep space research vessel the *Silver Minnow*. According to Dr. Irwin’s contacts and knowledge of the Science Foundation, the *Silver Minnow* was captained by Captain Vilarn Polustan and typically researched astrophysical phenomenon. The current mission was headed by a Dr. Phineas Collinston, a physicist who did his doctoral thesis on Slipstream Space. Dohpaz Vito contacted his team at Research Complex \#9, and discovered that an island a few miles east was being used as a supply depot for the research mission, which was expected to head to Luxia when they were finished.

Deciding to move ahead, they delivered Dohpaz Vito to his research complex mostly hidden on the jungle covered island. As they descended, Dohpaz Vito took the opportunity to talk with Jithal about coming to work for him on the device in the case.  Jithal said he needed to stay with his crew for now but would think about it.

Upon landing, Dohpaz Vito used his datapad to transfer payment to the *Dire Straits*’ account (doubled from the original amount as agreed,) while his security team watched from the ground.

The *Dire Straits* then headed back to Cuthbert Station, stopping at Zerzi Station to give Doctor Irwin’s Cronstak sapientologist colleague Dr. Indira Attenborough the specimens and biocorder scans of the unknown aliens, including plans of their ship.  Dr. Irwin believed she would be better equipped to analyze and publish the data. Dr. Irwin told Dr. Attenborough the scans and specimens were taken from a derelict ship that was falling into a star.

Chris, Jim Dade, and Steve Irwin had an uncomfortable conversation about Jim’s actions when the *Jitterbug* rendezvoused with the *Dire Straits.* Chris no longer trusted Jim Dade to have the crew’s best interests at heart. Finally, Chris conceded that although Jim Dade’s actions were unacceptable, his other actions for the crew, before and after the rendezvous, had earned him another chance to prove himself.
