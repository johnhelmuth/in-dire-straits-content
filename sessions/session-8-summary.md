The crew of the *Dire Straits*, Delano Mack, the survivors of the pirate attack of the *Siouxiana*, including Elizabeth
Catlow, tried to run the gauntlet of Ramekin Finch’s pirates, the Finchmen, through the Concourse of her pirate base.
They made it as far as the cargo airlock leading to the ships bay and the ships bay control room, although Steve Irwin
and the seriously injured Chris were separated from the rest of the crew during the attack of Ramekin Finch’s Mogri pet,
an enormous jumping spider with a roar like a lion.

Chris and Steve Irwin figured out a way to lure the Mogri away from the cargo airlock, which would hopefully allow them
to rejoin their friends. Jithal, Delano, and Jim continued to battle a new set of Finchmen, led by the Ohlzor pirate
leader Uvod Sulmaith.
