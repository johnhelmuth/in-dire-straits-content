The crew defeated Pirate Queen Ramekin Finch, for now, and escaped from her asteroid base, rescuing the survivors of the Siouxiana.

The Dire Straits with Chrysalis and the Jitterbug attached ferry the survivors of the Siouxiana to Zerzi Station. Before they reach the station's sensor envelope, Delano Mack undocks the Jitterbug from the Dire Straits to make his way separately to the station. Once the Dire Straits is docked, the survivors are quickly whisked into the medical wing of Zerzi Station. Delano Mack meets up with the crew near the hospital, but they are separated by a mob of press and paparazzi. Delano Mack and Jim Dade are caught up in the mob. Jim Dade has the data dump from the pirate base, and will deal with that as he can.

The Dire Straits leaves the station ahead of the mob of press and paparazzi. Delano Mack becomes the face of the Siouxiana rescue, while Jim Dade disappears in the crowd. Delano will be trying to get Elizabeth Catlow down to Zerzi City to talk to Bar Eewit about the data on her stick.
