  Jithal examines the stealth gear acquired from the ship that attacked them 
  while Delano Mack arranges to move the Strait Point Media Event to the 
  Carkargar Aerie, where it would be less likely they might be arrested by the 
  Baneseyes. 

  They arrive and meet up with Drakkot in the maintenance tunnels on Carkargar Aerie.

Jithal spent his time examining and testing the stealth unit that Chris pulled
from the ship that attacked them.

After some discussion, the crew decided that they did not want to risk running
into the Bane's Eye military by returning to the Scouts Guild offices on Alreekt
Station. If they could have the media event instead in the Carkargar Aerie, they
would minimize the risk of encountering the Baneseyes, and still get the Invicta
message out hidden in the recordings of the media event. Not to mention also
receiving the enormous cardboard check for discovering the new strait point in
Zerzi.

Delano Mack called the Scouts Guild office and talked to Drakkots, the executive
assistant to Voled Esso, the Scouts Guild Captain in Bane's Eye system.
Unwilling to move the venue for the media event on such short notice, but also
unwilling to just say "No" to Delano Mack, Drakkots had his boss join the call.

After some discussion, (including dropping Dr. Crimini's name), Voled agreed to
move the venue to the Carkargar Aerie. He thought he could get the event
rescheduled to happen there in about six hours. If the Dire Straits could be
there on time, he would have Drakkot send Delano the details of the event.

They travel across the system to Carkargar, and move the Dire Straits into a
parking orbit over the Aerie, leaving Teneral and the small frog-like engineer
locked in their cabins.

They take the shuttle down to the resort, landing amongst the crowd of ships on
the landing pad. The crew suit up and join the stream of So'enela and scattering
of other sapients moving to the airlocks into the tunnels of the resort. Moving
through the crowds on the main tunnel, they follow the directions Drakkots had
sent to them into the maintenance tunnels and away from the crowds.

Hoping they were not identified immediately by any Baneseye agents who might be
monitoring the cameras covering the crowds, they greet Drakkots and follow him
to where the event will happen.
