After catching some sleep and a meal, Steve Irwin needs to head into the bowels of the station to meet with his contact, Thunterperg Brelt, who works as a manager in the Alreekt station Algae Processing Facility number 7a, and is an amateur marine biologist. Thunterperg knows someone who is in the Banesian underground and has arranged for them to meet at her office. Jithal heads over first and scouts out the vents and ducts around the office, looking for a good spot to monitor the situation. After ensuring no one else is using the vents, he settles into a good spot. 

Before heading down to the office, Chris briefs Craln and the Lurbon’s Grackle crew on where they were going and asked them to provide backup. They agreed to station themselves near Thunterperg’s office.

Steve, Delano, and Chris meet Thunterperg in her office. Thunterperg is sorry that her contact messaged her they would be late, and she and Steve chat about his work. She brings up the plight of the Concord Narwhallaby, which is a sea creature that lives in the oceans of Concord, the main habitable planet of Concordist. She has a manuscript that she hopes will help to publicize its plight. They were interrupted by the door chime.

When the cloaked So’enela joins them in the cluttered office, she immediately turns hostile when she spots Chris as an Invicta. She obviously does not trust unknown Invicta for some reason. The crew attempted to get the So’enela to trust them so they can get a lead to where the Invicta princess ended up after escaping Dr. Crimini’s labs. After some earnest discussion, the So’enela was convinced that Chris was not there to take the princess back to the Invicta, he just wanted to talk to her.

Meanwhile Jithal noticed a figure moving quickly towards the office, carrying some weapons. He warned the crew in the office, and they turned towards the door just as it slid up and revealed an albino Invicta wearing the black uniform and head-cam of the Bane’s Eye Intelligence Service.  Brandishing his pistol, it called for the people in the office to turn and put their appendages against the wall, they were under arrest.

In the ensuing scuffle, the albino Invicta Baneseye was subdued by a combination of Jithal’s sneak tackle from the vent above the door, a clever use of Chris’s pheromones, and Steve’s calming words.

Although they quickly disabled the head-cam, they realized that Chris, Steve, Delano, Thunterperg, and the So’enela Banesian Underground member would be identified from the head-cam’s live-stream. They needed to get out of there fast before the Invicta Baneseye’s compatriots showed up.

The So’enela agent and Thunterperg left the tunnels with Craln and his crewmates to *Lurbon’s Grackle* and the Dire Straits crew left for the Dire Straits.
