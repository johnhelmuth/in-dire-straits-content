Back on the *Dire Straits*, Chris takes the Baneseye agent Teneral to the medbay and restrains him there. He creates a batch of pheromones that he knows will keep Teneral docile, and they talk for a bit.

Steve Irwin files a flight plan to undock from Alreekt, taking a retrograde stellar orbit to Carkargar. The space traffic control of Alreekt Station recognises Steve Irwin and the *Dire Straits*. Delano Mack undocks and starts on the flight plan and maneuvers the *Dire Straits* so it stays outside of the Alreekt’s sensor range, and so that it would take them about an hour to get back there.

The rest of the crew question Teneral.

TODO: Get details of what they learned from Teneral… I did not record this in my notes.

TODO: I do have a note: “Jithal defuses Teneral”... not sure what that means.

During the conversation Jithal notices a sensor glitch, similar to the glitch he saw when Jim Dade, Steve Irwin, and Dohpaz Vito went to meet Dohpaz’s business contact at Cuthbert Station. He lets the rest of the crew know. Chris jumps into Chrysalis and the rest of the crew take their stations.

If the glitch was caused by a stealthed ship like the one they fought at Cuthbert Station, they would best avoid another fight by moving into the more trafficked space near Alreekt.

This gambit does not pay off, as the stealthed ship powers up their weapons. This is the same class and design as the ship they defeated around Cuthbert. The Chrysalis launches aggressively, and weapons fire is exchanged. The hostile ship is disabled, its engineering section opened to the vacuum of space, one of the small unknown aliens is ejected from the engine compartment. Using knowledge of the ship they had explored after their battle at Cuthbert, Jithal lets Chris know which area holds the stealth gear. Chris uses Chrysalis’s short range lasers to cut out that compartment and pulls it free.

They pull the stolen equipment into the *Dire Straits* cargo hold, and rescue the alien survivor from the long fall into the star of Bane’s Eye.

TODO: What happened to the hulk of the opposing ship? I did write down that it was destroyed, but don't remember the conversation of how and when that happened, or what might be left behind.
