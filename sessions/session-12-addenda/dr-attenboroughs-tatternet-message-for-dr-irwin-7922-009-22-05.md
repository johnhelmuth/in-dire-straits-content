> Good luck strikes us today\! Dr. Barick happens to be in Zerzi system\! He is on an expedition to study gravity waves or slipstream space or something like that in Luxia. Apparently he hasn’t had much to do yet, so he was happy to check out the strange equipment for us\! His ship stopped at Zerzi Station and I couriered the gear over to him before it took off again.
