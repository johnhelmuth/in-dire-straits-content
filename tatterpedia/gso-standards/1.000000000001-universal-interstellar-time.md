Universal Interstellar Time

-   Units are seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, years.

    -   Known space is split between counting days as either the number
      of days since the beginning of the year (and not counting weeks
      at all), or since the beginning of the current week. Wars were
      fought between interstellar civilizations to reach the current
      state of the standard. Let's not mess with it any further.

-   Conversions
