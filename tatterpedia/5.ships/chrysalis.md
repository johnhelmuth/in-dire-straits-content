Defence:	Mediocre: (+0)
Movement:	Great (+4)
Sensors:	Fair (+2)
Guns:	Average (+1)
Melee:	Good (+3)

Clocks:
Maintenance needed: 6 segments, 0 full

_Each full segment represents some work that needs to be done on the ship to keep it running. When all segments are full, the ship fills a Consequence slot representing the system that has failed and what in that system needs to be fixed, and the Maintenance needed clock is cleared. Maintenance segments can be cleared through labor (1 person/week) and/or parts (determined by plot.) Segments might be marked if there is no regular opportunity to do maintenance labor within a week._

### Description

Inspirations are the Matrix Sentinel and the Ornithopter from Dune film. It resembles a 6-winged dragonfly. Rims of the articulable wings are plasma-jet outlets. Black 1-way glass viewports like a dragonfly’s eyes in the front. It can fly in a hyper-maneuverable, rapidly accelerating/decelerating way. Can full-stop quickly. Can hover.

Cockpit is separated from the passenger compartment, with independent life support. They share the airlock exit.

The passenger compartment has 4 acceleration chairs. Flights typically cause nausea for passengers.

The Chrysalis has a living nervous system alongside its circuitry, which the pilot integrates with to make a “shipmind.” Non-Invicta can do this imperfectly if taught how, but it’s hazardous. At least some of this neural tissue is visible in the gaps between the internal plating. Some sorts of neural damage are extremely hard or impossible to repair.

There is a shrine in a back alcove. (6-inch niche and figurine of an ant-like head projecting from a whirlpool, with a Saturn-like ringed planet in its mandibles.)   

The ship is often loaded with Chris’s chemistry set. He usually sleeps in the cockpit.

Weapons include weaponized landing gear (claws), articulable wing plasmajet engines (blades), and close-range melee fusion cutter lasers (a la the Sentinel from the Matrix.) A rapid-fire slug-thrower turret gun grafted onto the tail for a gunner that covers the aft and ventral arcs. Both ‘Chris’ and the shipmind despise the sensation of the grafted turret gun in the tail.
