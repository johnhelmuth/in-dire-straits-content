### Stunts:

**Grulvaxian Sensors**: Because Jithal has upgraded the sensors on the Dire Straits to his people’s standards, anyone
can use the ships sensors to detect and learn things that other systems in known space cannot detect.

### Clocks:

Maintenance needed: 6 segments, 0 full.

*Each full segment represents some work that needs to be done on the ship to keep it running. When all segments are
full, the ship fills a Consequence slot representing the system that has failed and what in that system needs to be
fixed, and the Maintenance needed clock is cleared. Maintenance segments can be cleared through labor (1 person/week)
and/or parts (determined by plot.) Segments might be marked if there is no regular opportunity to do 0maintenance
labor within a week.*

Ships credits: 2x6 segments, 2x6 full.

*Each full segment represents credits in your ship’s budget to pay for supplies, maintenance, and your ship’s lien
payments.*


Lien Cadence: 6 segments, currently 4 full.

*Each full segment represents time that has past since the last payment, payment is due when all segments are full.
Payment will clear 3 segments of the **Ships credits** clock.*
