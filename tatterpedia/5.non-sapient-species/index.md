## Molgri

A Molgri is a giant hunting arachnoid creature native to Dragongull’s Cry. Its exoskeleton is colored in gradated rose and brown. It has “hairs” across its back colored in various shades of blue. Each of its eight legs terminate in 2 large thick grey claws. It has 7 eyes: 3 small ones on either side of its head, and 1 large one facing forward. It has the attitude of a hunting cat, and can jump 20 feet from a standing start.

It shoots a caustic / hallucinogenic material out it’s spinnerets when it has cornered its prey and it is finished playing with it, that will cause them to experience whatever most terrifies them.

It is near extinction due to Dragongull’s Cry rising ocean waters destroying most of its native jungle habitat. There are very few off-planet from Dragongull’s Cry, most of them in zoos on Bane’s Eye.

The So’enela on Bane’s Eye enjoy going and seeing various terrifying alien creatures like the Molgri. The zookeepers on Bane’s Eye do not care about conservationism, only in training their charges for their daily shows to delight and terrify the crowds.
