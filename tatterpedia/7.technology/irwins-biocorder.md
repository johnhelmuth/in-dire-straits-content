title: Steve Irwin's Biocorder
---

## **Summary**

Irwin has a biocorder in his scientific kit. Its primary function is to
detect and potentially identify biological material by comparing it
against its (limited) database of known materials. It also has some
capacity to extrapolate probable information about unknown materials
based on known materials.

## **General Info**

-   There are a variety of makes and models of biocorders, but scans of
    a given sample will be identical regardless of make or model used
    (same data, obviously different metadata like timestamp, scientist
    name)

-   Where biocorders differ is in their capacity for analysis: a given
    biocorder has its own database of scans, its own machine models for
    analysis, and limited horsepower

-   In general, biologists share scans by contributing to a standard
    shared database, and there are shared standard models that
    scientists collaborate on

    -   There is some professional motivation for field biologists to
        find new types of samples and being the first to scan and share
        them

    -   But technically you don\'t have to share (i.e. often large
        corporations may have their own special/secret databases and/or
        models)

-   In general, a field biologist might do some rough preliminary
    analysis on their personal biocorder, but would be expected to take
    the scan to (personal) lab(s) for better analysis (bigger database,
    more horsepower)

-   Theoretical biologists just work on the models and often downplay
    how much their work relies on the input datasets of scans created by
    the field biologists

## **Capabilities**

-   It scans physical samples

-   It can store its scans for later use / analysis / sharing

-   At its most basic, it is an accurate spectroscope

-   It scans samples looking for known biological materials (such as the
    various alien equivalents to DNA, amino acids, etc.) in a sample

-   It has some capacity to identify unknown biological materials in a
    sample

-   Its accuracy in identifying a sample and/or its properties is (from
    highest to lowest):

    -   Sample is from a known (previously documented) species

    -   Sample is from an unknown species, but is from a known system
        (with other known species)

    -   Sample is from an unknown species, but is from a known lifeform
        base (carbon-based DNA life, etc.)

    -   Sample is from an unknown species with an unknown lifeform base

-   Given a DNA-equivalent, it can try to predict what the species looks
    like and basic physical attributes by attempting to simulate the
    process of \"building the DNA\"

## **Limitations**

-   It can only scan physical samples, not energy waves, etc.

-   It only works very close range (less than 3 inches)

-   It is a biologists tool - it\'s not meant to do what other
    specialist \"corders\" might

    -   Ex: It\'s not a medical device, it can\'t detect injuries or
        conditions (though it could detect \"foreign\" biological
        material in a host)

    -   It can\'t detect whether something is dead or not

-   Most of its \"advanced\" functionality is powered by the probability
    predictions of theoretical biology models - even if the device had
    the horsepower (it doesn\'t) the models themselves loose accuracy
    the deeper you push them (like weather forecasts)

-   It cannot determine behavior, social hierarchies, ecological niche,
    etc.

-   Even the predictions on what the species looks like can suffer
    greatly from \"dinosaur artist drawing a hippo based on its
    skeleton\"

## **Relevance to Irwin**

-   Irwin makes and shares his scans as a matter of due course

-   Technically, Irwin\'s career and reputation is solidified by the
    sheer quantity of scans he\'s made both in this cluster and others,
    and contributed to the standard database

-   Philosophically, Irwin puts more stock into the information he
    gathers first-hand and eventually shares in his books - the models
    are (admittedly often good) educated guesses, but his notes are real
    gathered facts

-   Irwin\'s experience means he has a very keen understanding for just
    how far to trust analysis results
