## Description

*Storms of shimmering mists negate most electronics on this world. This shimmer functions similarly to an electromagnetic pulse, and maintaining electricity is a major priority of this civilization. The population is resentful that their technological progress has been delayed by these storms, where other planets’ ‘race to the stars’ was not slowed.*

*A unique alloy made of rare materials (of “unobtainium” style) and secret metallurgy can armor against this electromagnetic pulse effect. A planet-wide effort to gather a stockpile of these materials enabled the population to “claw” off-planet. The military vessels of this planet lack FTL, but weaponize this unique electromagnetic pulse effect, making them formidable opponents.*

*This civilization has presence on most worlds in the local cluster, looking for more rare materials to expand the livable area of their homeworld and increase their ability to project power. This civilization has a faction that is content to live under the “shield” of shimmering storms, safe from external interference, at the cost of giving up advanced technology.*
