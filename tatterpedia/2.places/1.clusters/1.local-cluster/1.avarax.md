## Description

A perpetual hail of sharp, blue-violet crystals batters the mountains that criss-cross this world, within which most of
the population lives. The “synthetic” mountain ranges of metal plating and high-tech gun emplacements were reduced to
rubble by an overwhelming enemy. As terms of surrender, databases were wiped, computer viruses were deployed to scramble
technology, and all advanced power generation was banned. A force remains in orbit to monitor and regulate visitation.
This civilization has not invented the automobile, and uses primitive gunpowder firearms. Some believed that as part of
surrendering that a force would occupy their world--allowing some sort of galactic integration--but visitors are rare,
but several corporations specialize in sourcing (and profiteering from) essential needs.
