## Description

Delvar’s single harsh planet and lack of other resources meant that neither Adatharax nor Flant occupied it except for small naval bases which kept wary eye on each other… until it was discovered about 10 years ago by the crew of the XV Wyvern. A coalition of various organizations from known space funded the construction of a large space station that is in a stellar orbit near the inter-cluster strait point, hoping to turn the inhabitants of the new cluster into trading partners.
