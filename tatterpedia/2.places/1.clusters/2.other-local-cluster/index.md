## Star Systems

### Adatharax

***Strength through unity***

T2 E2 R-1

Connects to Clanpali and Egret

Single polity: The Dathian Planetary Alliance

### Balorn

***First Successful Colony***

***Bore the Brunt of the War***

T2 E1 R1

Connects to Adatharax, Clanpali, and Egret

Part of the Dathian Planetary Alliance

Although Balorn was first visited by Flant, they did not colonize it as they were focused on developing their Clanpali colony, and the subsequent rebellion.

Adatharax discovered Balorn on their first successful strait transition, and immediately started a colony there, which was successful.  When Flant arrived to colonize the system, things got grim, fast.

### Clanpali

***Fractured World***

***Former Rebel Colony of Flant***

***No Man’s Land***

T-1 E0 R1

Connects to Flant, Balorn, Adatharax, Delvar, and Egret

Clanpali and Balorn were the first 2 systems discovered by Flant, after it discovered the slipstream drive. Clanpali was the first colony Flant attempted, and it was successful enough to rebel against the home world. The colony was destroyed in the war, the planet was fractured through the use of a mega-weapon deployed by Flant.

### Delvar

***Gateway to the greater Universe***

***A Nice Place to Fly Through***

T-1 E-1 R-2

Connects to Egret, Adatharax, and Clanpali

Delvar’s single harsh planet and lack of other resources meant that neither Adatharax nor Flant occupied it except for small naval bases which kept wary eye on each other… until it was discovered about 10 years ago by the crew of the XV Wyvern. A coalition of various organizations from known space funded the construction of a large space station that is in a stellar orbit near the inter-cluster strait point, hoping to turn the inhabitants of the new cluster into trading partners.

### Egret

***Stop Treating Us Like Clanpali\!***

***Looking for a Seat at the Table***

T2 E2 R-1

Connects to Flant and Delvar

Egret was the 3rd system discovered by Flant, and the second (and only successful) colonization attempt.

### Flant

***The Prime Directive Protects You***

***Arrogant Elitists***

T3 E2 R4

Connects to Clanpali and Egret

Flant has the highest tech level, controls the most habitable planets, and has the most resources in their local cluster.
