## Description

Part of the Dathian Planetary Alliance

Although Balorn was first visited by Flant, they did not colonize it as they were focused on developing their Clanpali colony, and the subsequent rebellion.

Adatharax discovered Balorn on their first successful strait transition, and immediately started a colony there, which was successful.  When Flant arrived to colonize the system, things got grim, fast.
