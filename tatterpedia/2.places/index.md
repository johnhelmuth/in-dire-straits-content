## General

### Gas giant fuel refinery stations

In developing systems like Zerzi, fuel refinery stations are busy
places. A line of scoopships travel from the station to dip into the
upper atmosphere of the gas giant. Another line of full scoopships
return to the station to fill the tanks of the refinery. A cluster of in
system ships, asteroid miners mostly, with some cargo ships bringing
supplies out from inner planets, carefully navigate into their assigned
docks for refueling or off loading. Usually there\'s an enormous tanker
filling up with fuel to transport to other places in the system.
