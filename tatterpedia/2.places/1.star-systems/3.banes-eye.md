## Description

*“Bane’s Eye” dominates the local cluster. Looking up from its arid, rocky surface of mesas and oases, you can squint to see--visible in silhouette against its orange sun--another planetary body in the sky, a planet tinged red with iron craters, creating a “pupil-and-eye” visual impression that the eye of some god is perpetually staring down at “Bane’s Eye.’ The effect of the ancient religions of “Bane’s Eye” can be seen in the planetary modern culture’s obsession with themes of ‘being watched’ and ‘surveillance.’*

*This dominant star system is the only source of FTL starships in the local cluster. Banesian FTL drives are among the best anywhere, not just the local cluster, where they are the only choice (if you’re buying local. Without constant imports--constant success in diverting resources from the cluster to themselves--they might be forced to act drastically to sustain their technological power and simply take what they need. They have the most advanced computers and software, and attract the most adept scientific specialists, and are cordial with visitors, but residence must be earned. They take the long view, and their methodical approach to achieving their goals has allowed them to compensate for their often-drastic need for imports to sustain their technological level.*

*Methodical about their survival and continued dominance, a trade deal may only be finalized when “Bane’s Eye” is able to achieve the most favorable terms possible, and they greatly benefit from other systems in the local cluster competing, essentially, for their favor or protection. There are those who would certainly not mind if the space programs of other systems were to collapse or this reliance were to increase. Some wonder if more aggressive expansion is prudent, since they recognize they may only be a big fish in a shallow pond, compared to the broader galaxy. There is likely significant internal debate or outright conflict about these concerns, since “everything could come crashing down.”*

*Some of the religious bent on this world have a “prosperity gospel” mindset about their own success; others see themselves as holding the cluster together, with a divine duty, since most trade ships are made by, or sponsored by, “Bane’s Eye.” At the least, ships with FTL capacity must be registered with “Bane’s Eye” unless a registry code is spoofed.*

*But no one really knows how many ships they have, or their current military capacity--a strategic ambiguity.*
