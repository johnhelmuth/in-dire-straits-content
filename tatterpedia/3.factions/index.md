### Science Foundation

Independent of any local or cluster government(s)
  -  the **Science
Foundation** is the premiere scientific professional scientific
organization in the cluster
  -  a non-profit devoted to promoting quality
scientific research. It oversees a hierarchy of per-world member
organizations and broader per-discipline organizations.

Because the Science Foundation is so large
  -  and covers so many areas of
study
  -  there are definitely factions with in it
  -  some of which are
barely aware of others
  -  even within smaller clusters like the local
cluster. Some researchers rely on funding from various military
organizations
  -  and others rely on public funding.

-   [Dr. Crimini](/tatterpedia/faces#dr-crimini) - the cluster's foremost Theoretical Biologist from
    Bane's Edge. A powerful figure in the Science Foundation.

  -   Like most sciences
  -  Biology as a field has itself evolved over
      time (think early hyper-focus on classification and taxonomy) to
      the point that now
  -  the highest (and therefore most prestigious
  - 
      well-funded
  -  etc.) branch is Theoretical Biology
  -  relying almost
      exclusively on pure computation and clean mathematical models of
      life.


### The Syndicate

The Syndicate is an organized crime organization that is spread across
most of the local cluster and the connecting clusters both coreward and
rimward. With good PR resources
  -  they maintain a public face in most
systems as local do-gooders
  -  just helping the little guy.


### Scouts Guild

The Scouts Guild is spread across known space
  -  independent of any
planet-bound polities. Members of the Scout\'s guild are Pilots who have
been sponsored by an existing member
  -  and who pay an annual membership
fee. The membership fees are nominal
  -  but spread out over known space
  - 
they add up. They also re-sell the slipstream strait parameters to
non-members as well
  -  at a hefty mark-up
  -  so navigation information in
general is spread widely. Corporations or other organizations are not
allowed membership
  -  only individual people
  -  of any species
  -  as long as
they can pass a rigorous suite of piloting tests.

The Guild offers support for down on their luck pilots
  -  such as hostels
near space ports
  -  retirement & pension plans
  -  etc. They maintain offices
and facilities in most systems that receive FTL traffic.

In addition to membership dues
  -  the Guild earns income by buying up new
slipstream strait parameters
  -  and re-selling them to corporations and
non-members. Members in the Guild automatically receive new slipstream
strait parameters for free as part of the benefits of membership.


### Vat Clones Organization

There is a shadowy organization that produces [Vat
Clones](/tatterpedia/sapient-species#vat-clones) and hires them out as mercenaries.
Most people have no idea how you would go about hiring new vat clones
  - 
but they keep showing up in the wars that spring up across known space.


### Banesian Underground

There are rumours that there is a group of people
  -  the *Banesian
Underground* on Bane's Eye who work against the current government
  -  that
they consider to be illegitimate and fascist. These rumours are
suppressed by Bane's Eye operatives whenever they crop up.

### Kel-Azaan Resistance

A coalition of distant interstellar civilizations on the far side of known space
who fought against the [Invicta Swarm](/tatterpedia/sapient-species#invicta-swarm) expansion in the last decade or so.

### Tepchania Institute of Technology

A prestigious engineering university on [Tepchania](places#tepchania). Informally known as TIT.

### Majestic Services

A company incorporated in Bane’s Eye that runs several passenger liners within the local cluster
  -  including the _Siouxiana_
  -  which destroyed by the Pirate Queen Ramekin Finch on 7922-007.

### Galactic Standards Organization (GSO)

The GSO is an intergalactic standards body that maintains and publishes technical
  -  social
  -  and spiritual standards used by sapients everywhere.

The GSO's work is funded by membership dues. Most polities
  -  universities
  -  organizations
  -  and large corporations in known space are members of the GSO
  -  and
include representatives in the various working groups that determine the standards.
