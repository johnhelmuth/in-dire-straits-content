  are image heavy

### Game Information

I re-worked some of the text for
the [Local Cluster Creation](/rules-and-systems/local-cluster-creation)
page and added diagrams for the "Link systems" example section. I also added a
short description of how we allowed players to modify system attributes after
systems were linked up with FTL routes.

### New Features

Reworked the pages that were image heavy (like the sapient species page) so
that links from the table of contents were not nerfed by the Markdown rendering
engine.
