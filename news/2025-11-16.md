### Game Information

Today I updated the summary for [Game Session 16](/sessions/session-16-summary)
and added a summary for [Game
Session 17](/sessions/session-16-summary).

### New Features

* I added a [news section](/news) for little notes like this.


* Last week I changed the cluster maps page so that there was a
  separate [page](/map/in-dire-straits-cluster) for
  [each](/map/neighbor-cluster) [cluster](/map/other-local-cluster), including
  a [page with a nice list of clusters](/maps).


* I'm continuing to work on user registration process, adding in email
  capability for email verification and password reset. I want to get this
  finished before I start work on editing these pages in-place.
