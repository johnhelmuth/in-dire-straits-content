## Description

*A century ago, a garden world in this system was destroyed by a freak asteroid. Conspiracy theories around this event \-- whether it could have been stopped by a stellar civilization, whether it was a secret attack by someone powerful, whether it was a divine punishment \-- have propagated since. Fallen rubble from this planet raised the sea levels and seeded what would become the profitable mining, deep sea dredging operations and vibrant coral reefs on the one remaining garden world. With sufficient self-made space-craft to patrol their borders, but not put up effective resistance.*
