## Description

*Only recently discovered, Golden Seed orbits a distant pulsar. Its pulsar is its guardian. It is almost impossible to
approach in force of numbers: It is protected from fleet invasion or occupation by extremes of gravity, dense asteroid
fields and nebulae, and lancings of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.*

*Golden Seed shows extreme, conspicuous luck in supporting life at all. In fact, though, life is relatively comfortable.
Even non-native species tolerate its high gravity fairly well, though they tire more quickly.*

*Tidally-locked, its proximal, pulsar-facing-side is scorched in x-rays and high-energy particles, but its distal,
outward-facing side experiences nearly no harmful effects. The soil is naturally enriched; minerals rare elsewhere are
incorporated into basic architecture. Golden Seed awaits only the right genius or entrepreneur to rapidly accelerate
past its pre-atomic technological level and become a dominant force in the cluster.*
